# **Spencer's Phase 4 Project README **

## *Overview of project:*

This project creates a website where:
-The user can see a list of all the dogs that are available for adoption as well as their current location and current owner.
-The user can remove a dog from the list by clicking the adopt button under that dog.
-The user can edit a dog by clicking the edit button under that dog.
-The user can add a dog by clicking add a dog in the navigation menu. This will take you to a form you will need to submit. 

There are different validations in place so that the data that is received into the flask server is good data.
